=== PascalCase for ComponentNames


=== kebab-case for directories and file-names

This is highly subjective, but there are reasons to use kebab-case for directories and file names.
One reason is: if you want to turn a directory into a package, you can do so without changing the name.
According to the https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json[Node.js documentation],
the package should not have an uppercase letter in the name.
This leaves us with snake_case and kebab-case.
The latter is more common in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Therefore, we configured biome for kebab-case file names and thus should also apply to directories.
